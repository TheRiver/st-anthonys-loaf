# Soup kitchen emails

A simple email system for use in my groups role playing game.

To run locally:

```shell

pnpm install
pnpm dev

```
the `pnpm dev` command will provide a link to view the page in your browser. 

If you want to make the page visible on your local network, run instead:

```shell
pnpm dev --host
```
